# micro:net 

> Exercises to introduce Networking and Communication with the BBC micro:bit

Our aim is to create a series of interactive lessons for students to create, visualise and explore networks; we will use a small fleet of micro:bits to transform a classroom into a mini network: a micro:net. This setup can be used to demonstrate data packetisation, routing, address translation, security issues and much more. The series, and each lesson itself, will be structured to progress in difficulty, thus the resources should be suitable for different age tiers, abilities, or curriculums.

**It's still early days for this project; more information coming soon!**
